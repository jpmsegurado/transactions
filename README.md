# Transactions App

This is a project for a review process challenge, and it's basically a transactions app, where the user can add transactions, see all the transactions, and watch the total sum of them. Used `create-react-app` to start.

# What libs did I use
- `react` for the components
- `redux` to share state beetween components
- `react-router-dom` for navigations links and history
- `lodash/fp` to get only the functions necessary from `lodash`
- `styled-components` to add CSS encapsulation
- `styled-icons` for an icon lib who works well with `styled-components`
- `jest` and `enzyme` for unit tests

# How do I run the project
- Clone the project
- run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- run `npm start` to run the project

Although it's not necessary to clone the project to visualize, it is available [here](https://transactions-94fc0.firebaseapp.com/)
