# Transactions App

This is a project for a review process challenge, and it's basically a transactions app, where the user can add transactions, see all the transactions, and watch the total sum of them. Used `create-react-app` to start.

# What libs did I use
- `react` for the components
- `redux` to share state beetween components
- `lodash/fp` to get only the functions necessary from `lodash`

# How do I run the project
- Clone the project
- run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- run `npm start` to run the project
